Use fresh burger buns for best taste.
As per the actual recipe,u have to refrigerate the boiled potatoes for 6 hours. But I skipped that step.
I have used corn flakes powder instead of corn meal here. U can add corn meal if u have in hand.
I coated the patty twice in the batter & bread crumbs to make a crispy exterior. But make sure oil is in right temperature else patty will get burnt.
You can make the patties instantly instead of refrigerating it for 30 minutes. In that case,take a ball of dough and pat it to bring the shape and proceed as given above.
If you are planning to make this for parties, you can make the dough very well in advance and refrigerate it by tightly wrapping in sheet & keep it covered. This dough stays good for 2 days in refrigerator if  properly stored.
Adjust the quantity of mayonnaise as per your taste.You can also add keep some onion rings,tomato slices & cheese slices if you like.
